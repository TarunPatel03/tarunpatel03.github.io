## Problem / Motivation

I wanted to explore algorithmic trading by combining my programming skills with financial market analysis.  
The goal was to build an automated system that could analyze market data, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades without human intervention.  
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in machine learning for time-series forecasting, trading APIs, and automation â€” all under real market conditions.

## System Architecture

- **Data Collection:** Fetched historical and live price data via broker APIs.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, EMA) and statistical features for model input.
- **ML Model:** Trained a machine learning model on historical price movements to predict short-term market direction.
- **Strategy Logic:** Combined model predictions with risk management rules for trade entry/exit.
- **Execution Engine:** Integrated with broker API for order placement, stop-loss, and take-profit handling.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Recorded all trades, predictions, and performance metrics for evaluation.

## Key Technical Challenges

- Ensuring low-latency execution for high-volatility instruments.
- Preventing overfitting in the ML model by applying proper cross-validation and feature selection.
- Handling API rate limits and reconnection logic for stable operation.
- Implementing dynamic position sizing based on account equity and volatility.
- Designing a modular codebase to quickly swap or test different strategies and models.

## Future Work & Expansion

- Integrate reinforcement learning to adapt strategies in real-time.
- Expand asset coverage to include forex, crypto, and commodities.
- Deploy on a cloud server with 24/7 uptime monitoring.
- Build a web dashboard for real-time performance tracking.
- Add sentiment analysis from news and social media to improve predictions.
