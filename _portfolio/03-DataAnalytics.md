## Problem / Motivation

With the huge volume of financial market data available, traders and analysts need tools that can quickly visualize trends, extract insights, and evaluate trading hypotheses.  
This project aimed to create a modular Jupyter Notebook pipeline that could pull live and historical market data, generate technical analysis indicators, and test trading ideas in an interactive, data-driven way.

## System Architecture

- **Data Sources:** Pulled historical and real-time price data from APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Binance API, Alpha Vantage).
- **Data Processing:** Used Pandas for cleaning, structuring, and transforming raw price data.
- **Indicators:** Implemented key technical indicators such as EMA, SMA, MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Visualization:** Generated interactive charts using Matplotlib and Plotly to display market structure, indicators, and trading zones.
- **Backtesting:** Applied strategy logic over historical datasets to assess profitability and drawdowns.
- **Exporting Reports:** Automatically generated performance summaries and strategy result charts.

## Key Technical Challenges

- Optimizing API calls to handle large datasets without rate-limiting errors.
- Synchronizing multiple timeframes for combined indicator analysis.
- Creating a flexible code structure that allowed swapping out datasets, strategies, and timeframes.
- Building visualizations that are both clear for presentation and detailed for deep analysis.

## Future Work & Expansion

- Add sentiment analysis from financial news and social media.
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Deploy as a lightweight web app for real-time monitoring.
- Automate daily report generation and email delivery.

## Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, TA-Lib, Jupyter Notebook, Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage API, Binance API, Data Visualization, Backtesting
