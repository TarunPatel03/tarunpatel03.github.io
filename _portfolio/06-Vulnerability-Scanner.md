## Problem / Motivation

Security teams often rely on raw Nmap output that’s noisy and hard to turn into executive-ready deliverables.  
This project builds a **defender-focused scanner** that automates discovery, enriches findings with **CVE data & CVSS scores**, and exports a clean **PDF report** with remediation guidance—ideal for lab environments, small businesses, or coursework assessments.

> **Ethical use:** Designed for authorised testing on networks you own or have explicit permission to assess.

## System Architecture

- **Discovery & Fingerprinting:** Nmap SYN scans with service & version detection; parses Nmap XML.
- **CVE Enrichment:** Maps detected services (CPE/versions) to CVEs; pulls CVSS v3.1 scores; local cache to avoid rate limits.
- **Risk Scoring:** Aggregates per-host risk with severity breakdowns (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
- **False-Positive Control:** Version matching + CPE heuristics to reduce noisy matches.
- **Reporting:** Generates a professional PDF (executive summary, asset table, per-host findings, remediation).
- **Data Store:** Saves scan runs to SQLite/JSON for diffs and trend tracking.
- **CLI:** `quick` vs `full` modes, JSON/CSV/PDF outputs, safe defaults (no intrusive flags).
- **Optional Enrichment:** Shodan lookup for public exposure context (key-gated).

## Key Technical Challenges

- Robustly parsing Nmap XML across edge cases and incomplete banners.  
- Accurate CVE mapping from versions/CPEs while handling ambiguous fingerprints.  
- Caching & throttling external lookups to survive API limits.  
- Designing a report that’s readable for execs yet detailed for engineers.  
- Safe defaults and guardrails to prevent unintended intrusive scans.

## Future Work & Expansion

- Authenticated checks (SSH/Samba/HTTP) where creds are provided.  
- TLS posture analysis (protocols/ciphers, HSTS, misconfigs).  
- Differential “since last scan” change reports and alerting.  
- HTML dashboard + REST API; Docker packaging; CI + unit tests.  
- EPSS/KEV integration to prioritise exploitability/exposure.

## Technologies Used

Python 3.11, Nmap (python-nmap), ReportLab, SQLite, Requests, dotenv, XML parsing, (optional) Shodan API, Pandas.

## Screens & Outputs (examples)

- **Executive Summary:** asset count, open ports by severity, top risky hosts.  
- **Per-Host Detail:** services → mapped CVEs with CVSS, evidence, remediation.  
- **Appendix:** raw ports table, scan parameters, and data sources.
