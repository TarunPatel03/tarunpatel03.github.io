# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  I am a passionate and systems-focused software engineering student with a strong foundation in low-level C programming and embedded systems. I have developed real-time microcontroller projects using AVR C and am currently building STL-style containers in C++ to understand memory management and iterator design. I thrive in environments where I can work at the hardware-software boundary and am excited to grow into a Linux kernel engineering role. I aim to contribute to open-source systems like Ubuntu while developing deep kernel expertise within a globally distributed team.
